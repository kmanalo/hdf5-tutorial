HDF5-tutorial
============

Notes on running test examples:
-------------------------------

They are tested purely against the software stack yielded by:
`load-modules run`

and the Makefile is specific to the hdf5 parallel Fortran `h5pfc` compiler
(parallel).

`make` to see the options.

There is a script to download and build hdf5 on the HPC PACE Cluster, which
will install the hdf5 libraries and compilers into ~/data/hdf5, the Fortran
2003 examples will not work otherwise.
